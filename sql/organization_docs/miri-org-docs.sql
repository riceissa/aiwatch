        'Issa Rice divides MIRI research employees between "mathematicians" and "engineers" and notes that recently, MIRI has hired mostly engineers and not mathematicians. He also considers the example of Nate Soares, whose background prior to joining MIRI matched the engineer profile, but who still joined and did initial work as a mathematician. His post asks the question of whether this suggests it is harder to become a MIRI mathematician in 2019 (the time of writing the post) compared to 2013. The post includes a list of potential differences between the time periods.' /* notes */

        'Evan Hubinger, who has just finished an internship at OpenAI with Paul Christiano and others, is going to start work at MIRI. His research will be focused on solving inner alignment for amplification. Although MIRI''s research policy is one of nondisclosure-by-default https://intelligence.org/2018/11/22/2018-update-our-new-research-directions/ Hubinger expects that his own research will be published openly, and that he will continue collaborating with researchers at institutions like OpenAI, Ought, CHAI, DeepMind, FHI, etc. In a comment, MIRI Executive Director Nate Soares clarifies that "my view of MIRI''s nondisclosed-by-default policy is that if all researchers involved with a research program think it should obviously be public then it should obviously be public, and that doesn''t require a bunch of bureaucracy. [...] the policy is there to enable researchers, not to annoy them and make them jump through hoops."
